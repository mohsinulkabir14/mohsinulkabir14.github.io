I'm a second year [ELLIS PhD](https://ellis.eu/) student at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). I'm supervised by [Prof. Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). 

My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Social Science, and Culturally Adaptive NLP applications. I am particularly interested in understanding how language models can better reflect and respect human culture.
<ul>
  <li> <b>Cultural Understanding in Language Models</b>:
  I am intrigued by the question- as autoregressive generators, can modern language models truly perceive and represent culture, which evolves over thousands of years, as humans do?</li>

  <li> <b>Culturally Adapted NLP</b>:
  My recent work explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to culturally sensitive domains such as mental health, irony, and sarcasm, where context and cultural nuance play a crucial role.</li>

  <li> <b>Cultural Bias</b>:
  I am also interested in understanding how cultural bias is manifested and propagated in language models. I approach this through the lens of interpretability to uncover its roots and explore ways to mitigate it.</li>


</ul>

I aim to build NLP systems that go beyond linguistic accuracy, incorporating cultural awareness and empathy into machine understanding of human language.
